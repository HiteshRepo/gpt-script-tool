# .gptscriptignore - Files and patterns to exclude from commit message generation
# 
# This file works similar to .gitignore but specifically for the commitmessager.gpt script
# Each line can contain:
# - Specific file names (e.g., config.json)
# - Directory names (e.g., node_modules/)
# - Glob patterns (e.g., *.log, test/*)
# - Comments start with # and are ignored
# - Empty lines are ignored

# Example patterns (uncomment to use):
# *.log
# *.tmp
# node_modules/
# dist/
# .env
# package-lock.json
# yarn.lock
